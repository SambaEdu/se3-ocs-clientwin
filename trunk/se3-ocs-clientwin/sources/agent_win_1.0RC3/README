What's new
----------

This new release of Win32 Agent 1.0 RC3 adresses the following bugs:

Package deployment:
* https server and http server can be normalized ressources location
(hostname[:XX][/../..]).
* md5 checksum computing bug fixed.
* info file can now be located deeper than the https server document root.
* LAUNCH action now support parameters.

Launcher OcsLogon:
* When using /DEPLOY command line switch, launcher does not download every time
agent. It download it only if update is needed.

 

How to install
--------------

You must know the following things:
- Host running OCS Inventory NG Communication Server
- Port of OCS Inventory NG Communication Server

To install agent as a service, run OcsAgentSetup.exe. You can use following
command line switches:
- /S Use quiet, silent installation
- /SERVER:IP_ADDRESS Use Commincation Server address “IP_ADDRESS”
- /PNUM:XX Use port XX instead of default HTTP port 80.
- /NP Do not use Microsoft Internet Explorer Proxy settings
- /DEBUG Produce a log file of OCS Inventory NG agent execution. This mode is
automatically used under Windows to launch agent as a service through an entry
in registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices.

To deploy/launch agent from a login script, rename OcsLogon.exe with address
of your Communication Server and call it from your login script between double
quotes and with /DEPLOY:4026 command line switch. If server is running on
another port XX than standard HTTP port 80, use /PNUM:XX command line switch.
To avoid using MS Internet Explorer proxy settings, use /NP command line switch.
Example: "\\server\share\192.168.1.1.exe /DEPLOY:4026 /NP"

To inventory a stand alone computer non connected to network, just run
OcsAgent.exe /local.

On any problem, run with /DEBUG command line switch to create log files.
 
Enjoy OCS Inventory NG ;-)
